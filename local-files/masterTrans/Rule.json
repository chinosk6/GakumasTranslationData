You must inform recipients that the Source\r\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\r\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License.

Termination\r\n--------------\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div>\r\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\r\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\r\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\r\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\r\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\r\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\r\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\r\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\r\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\r\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\r\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\r\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\r\nYour receipt of the notice.\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div>\r\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\r\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\r\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\r\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\r\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\r\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div>\r\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\r\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\r\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\r\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\r\n</div>\r\n<br>\r\n<div>\r\n************************************************************************\r\n*                                                                      *\r\n*  6.
